        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vesper Martini. The <strong>actual</strong> James Bond martini.  Contrary to popular belief, the James Bond martini is not a
        "vodka martini, shaken not stirred". As it was written by Ian Fleming, the martini was called the Vesper and it likens itself to 
        "drinking like a cloud" <em>(as my brother stated after he drank it for the first time)</em>.</p>
        <p>The original recipe calls for a Russian grain vodka of which I usually choose Belvedere. It also calls for Kina Lillet which 
        actually ceased it's production in 1986 whick makes aquiring a bottle next to impossible. A good substitute which we will use 
        is Lillet Blanc which can be found at any liquor store. Lastly, it calls specifically for Gordon's Gin which is a deliciously smooth
        and affordable gin that is very easy to find.</p>
        <p>Without further ado. Let's drink!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2oz Gordon's Gin</li>
            <li>1oz Belvedere Vodka</li>
            <li>1/2oz Lillet Blanc</li>
            <li>1 Large, thin Lemon Peel</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put your martini glasses in the freezer</li>
            <li>In a shaker, combine the Gin, Vodka, and Lillet and shake until frosty</li>
            <li>Strain into your chilled glasses</li>
            <li>Roll and squeeze the lemon peel and then rim the glass with it</li>
            <li>Garnish with Lemon Peel</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
